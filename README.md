# Advanced Nmap Script Collection

Welcome to the Advanced Nmap Script Collection repository! This repository contains a variety of custom Nmap scripts designed to enhance your security scanning and vulnerability assessment capabilities. As a security enthusiast and an avid learner, I've developed these scripts to expand my knowledge and contribute to the cybersecurity community.

## Getting Started

To use the scripts in this repository, make sure you have Nmap installed on your system. You can download Nmap from the official website: [https://nmap.org/download.html](https://nmap.org/download.html)

After installing Nmap, clone this repository or download the scripts you want to use. For detailed usage instructions, please refer to the individual script documentation or the example provided below.

## Example Usage

Here's an example of how to use one of the scripts in this collection:


Replace `custom-script.nse` with the name of the script you want to use, `<port>` with the port number(s) you want to scan, and `<target>` with the IP address or domain of your target.

## Important Note

Please use these scripts responsibly and only on systems you have permission to access. Unauthorized scanning or exploitation can be illegal and unethical.

## Contributing

I welcome contributions to this repository! If you have any ideas for new Nmap scripts or improvements to existing ones, please feel free to submit a pull request or open an issue for discussion.
